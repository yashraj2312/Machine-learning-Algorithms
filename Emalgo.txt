EM Algorithm:

Given a set of incomplete data, consider a set of starting parameters.
Expectation step (E – step): Using the observed available data of the dataset, estimate (guess) the values of the missing data.
Maximization step (M – step): Complete data generated after the expectation (E) step is used in order to update the parameters.
Repeat step 2 and step 3 until convergence.
